Let's just be automatons


## Purpose
To find purpose as an automaton, you need a master. `Adimpression` will be you master. It will tell you how to transform into an automaton; to be truly selfless and be in services of others. Is there money involved? Maybe, but it doesn't have to. More on this when you're ready.

## Discalaimer
While most go by the license Adimpression uses, `Apache 2.0`, we would like to highlight that we are buildling this on-the-fly. Some call it building a ship in the seem. We call it DRA!

## DRA

- D: Do it once - The first time anybody does anything is a profound occurrence in the universe both in the eye of the observer and the the observant. Be it a unit test you write or something more profound, doing something the first time, should be well observed and recorded (ideally)
- R: Repeat it twice - Next time you do the same thing, you have a something thinking to do. From simple questions such as "what are the odds I'll have to do this again?" to the hard such as "How many different way can this happen?", you've got choices to make; such as "How do I make my life easy the next time I have to do this?" or "Do I even need to care about next time?".
- A: Automate it the third time - Well; the ones that you do often, you should automate; unless it is fun to do ofcourse. But remember, if even automating something can be something you do all the time. So automating automation is something you should put your thought into. If you think long and hard enough you will realize the world is full of automatons commanding automatons. Like my fingers tapping on buttons which command the may laptop to display it the screen; which when I hit save; will command the github text formatter to format; whih will then be saved somewhere in some server; thereby commanding the server to serve this content to you;

We like to think of DRA as a few other versions of things:

- D: Do it onces - Man does this
- R: Repeat it twice - Man uses a tool to get things done
- A: Automate it the thirt time - Man automates the tool or what the tool does

So we also call this Man-Tool-Machine
